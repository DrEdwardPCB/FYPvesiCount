# JAVA-FYPvesiCount-GUI
This project is initiate due to the fact that I don't know how to use ImageJ to count number of dots in a fluorescence microscope picture which is important for my FYP. Therefore, I write this programme to assist my counting of  hundreds of thousand bright dots of different categlory in multiple taken in fluorescence microscope

## important notes
